Tabris.js project template
==========================

This is a template for creating tabris.js projects with the njsdoc JSDT tooling.

It provides a basic project structure, project metadata and an inline documentation of tabris functionality. The editor support content assist on tabris functions as well as on widgets that have been created with tabris.create. It also provides code completion for the JQuery subset supported by tabris, e.g. $.getJson. To make use of jQuery the library needs to be included in the project.
